  description: I'll be honest, I started the TV show and then couldn't wait for more episodes so I read the book in 2 days.
  highlights:
    - Mia realized that she was crossing into a place she would have to go alone.
    - A lifetime of practical and comfortable considerations settled atop the spark inside her like a thick, heavy blanket.

  description: I really liked Tolentino's essays, but I almost already agreed with them so much that I found reading this kind of boring?
  highlights:
    - Writing is either a way to shed my self-delusions or a way to develop them. A well-practiced, conclusive narrative is usually a dubious one.

  description: I'd recommend this to anyone considering therapy but feeling apprehensive about it.
  highlights:
    - Maybe happiness is sometimes.
    - Instead of leaning into the goodness that comes their way, they become hypervigilant, always waiting for something to go wrong.

  description: I started this a few years ago and I finally picked it back up and finished it. I think I didn't get Moshfegh's writing at first, but after I read My Year Of Rest And Relaxation I understood her work better. It's brutally honest and darkly funny (...like many books on here)
  highlights:
    - I hated my boyfriend but I liked the neighborhood.

  highlights:
    - Judaism had taught her to keep running, no matter who tried to hold her hostage. It had taught her to create her own opportunities, to turn rock into water and water to blood. It had taught her that such things were possible.
    - Something is pulling her back to the person she’s been all along.

  description: Carmen Maria Machado is my favorite author right now and I was so excited
    to read this memoir. She puts words to the felt but unspoken like no other. She
    brings to light how unproductive archetypes of traumatic experiences can be, and
    how the subtleties of the less extreme ones can fall through the cracks.
  highlights:
    - I toss the stone of my story into a vast crevice; measure the emptiness by its small sound.
    - The nature of archival silence is that certain people's narratives and their nuances are swallowed by history; we see only what pokes through because it is sufficiently salacious for the majority to pay attention.

  description: This crystalized so many things I've been feeling and thinking lately.
    What I actually have to say about this book needs much more than a little blurb
    here. This presents a reframing on our lives today that we'd all benefit from
    reflecting on. It also inspired me to start learning the trees around San Francisco,
    particularly at the park I mostly read this book in.
  highlights:
    - Yet we inhabit a culture that privileges novelty and growth over the cyclical and the regenerative. Our very idea of productivity is premised on the idea of producing something new, whereas we do not tend to see maintenance and care as productive in the same way.

  date: 09/12/2019
  highlights:
    - It is the story of the ugly decisions made around user data and personal information as technology firms seek to exploit consumer data. But most of all, it is a story about how blind worship of startup founders can go wildly wrong, and a cautionary tale that ends in spectacular disaster.

  description: This was a really sweet, easy read.
  highlights: Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very
    far away, happening without her, and she didn’t know if she would ever find out
    where it was and become part of it.

  description: This is a story about the apocalypse, but it is much more a story about
    our routines and how they form us.
  highlights: To live in a city is to live the life that it was built for, to adapt
    to its schedule and rhythms, to move within the transit layout made for you during
    the morning and evening rush, winding through the crowds of fellow commuters.
    To live in a city is to consume its offerings. To eat at its restaurants. To drink
    at its bars. To shop at its stores. To pay its sales taxes. To give a dollar to
    its homeless.

  description: This made me appreciate good government even more than I already do.
    It was also horrifying for that same reason.
  highlights:
    - We don’t really celebrate the accomplishments of government employees. They exist in our society to take the blame.

  description: This is one of many form-bending absurdist short story collections
    I've read lately and I'm happy to be continuing the phase.
  highlights:
    - The things that are the most important aren't shared; they are important to only us.

  description: Sometimes all you can do is bare witness.
  highlights:
    - I am weary of all our sad stories—not hearing them, but that we have these stories to tell, that there are so many.

  date: 05/30/2019
  description: This is the funniest book I've read in such a long time. I thought
    it was actually really loving towards men and it was a good reminder that dating
    is supposed to be fun. I loved her point about how easy it is for women to fall
    into supporting a partner, and how important it is to forge your own path and
    focus on your own art.
  highlights:
    - 'Whatever happens will happen, but the pay is certain: you''ll always be able to write, or talk, or paint, or knit (why do people knit??) about it. You can make it into something beautiful or hilarious or genius or so incredibly dumb that it''s hilarious and genius.'

  date: 05/27/2019
  description: This book is about a woman who basically takes a butt load of drugs
    and fucks off for a year. It's from her point of view, so as you can imagine,
    this was incredibly depressing, and made me feel kind of insane. But I must have
    liked it because I plowed through it in one day, and it was actually weirdly funny.
  highlights:
    - Rejection, I have found, can be the only antidote to delusion.

  description: Still reading this one, but already loving how poetic science can be.
    In a weird way, it talks about  some of the same themes that Her Body And Other
    Parties does.
  highlights:
    - 'Perhaps poetry is another of science''s deepest roots: the capacity to see beyond the visible.'

  description: I love this one so much I've been rereading it. I'm forced me to grapple
    with the absurdity of what it feels like to move through the world as myself,
    and it resonates in a way that can only be felt. The way form and structure are
    twisted delights me over and over again. It makes me feel like I'm losing my mind
    in the best way. We live in an illogical world and trying to make sense of it
    is what makes us crazy.
  highlights:
    - I took a step toward her. “It is my right to reside in my own mind. It is my right,” I said.

  description: This story makes my whole chest hurt.
  highlights:
    - And so we stood together like that, at the top of that field for whatseemed like ages, not saying anything, just holding each other, while the windkept blowing and blowing at us, tugging our clothes, and for a moment, it seemed like we were holding onto each other because that was the only way to stop us from being swept away into the night.

  description: I like this book so much that I have trouble getting through it. Every
    sentence feels like a whole universe that I want to soak up and live in. I think
    a lot about how the stories we tell shape our lives and Rebecca Solnit says it
    more beautifully than I ever could.
  highlights:
    - Stories are compasses and architecture, we navigate by them, we build our sanctuaries and our prisons out of them, and to be without a story is to be lost in the vastness of a world that spreads in all directions like arctic tundra or sea ice.

  description: I read a bunch of Vonnegut a few years ago when I had a long commute
    into Brooklyn, and somehow missed this one. His books are always easy for me to
    pick up when I'm not in the mood to read anything else.
  highlights:
    - The on button simply started a flight from Mars. The off button was connected to nothing. It was installed at the insistence of Martian mental-health experts, who said that human beings were always happier with machinery they thought they could turn off.

  description: I should have read this years ago, but I'm glad I finally did.
  highlights:
    - Everybody gossips, so if you are going to gossip about your friends, at least make it fun and interesting. As a corollary, never say “I never lie” or “I never gossip” because you are lying.

  highlights:
    - As a grown woman, I would have said to my father that there are true things in this world observed only by a single set of eyes.
