  description: This is one of those books that will stay with me a long time because it gave me a new framework through which to see the world. I'm also very happy it introduced me to the phrase "heuristic reaction." I love words. I love language. I love understanding how language shapes who we are and how we move through the world together.
  highlights:
    - With words, we breathe reality into being.
    - They were raised to see the good in people, even to their own detriment.
    - In this way, it’s not desperation or mental illness that consistently suckers people into exploitative groups—instead, it’s an overabundance of optimism.

  date: 9/9/2021
  description: I wasn't sure for a while, but after this I've decided I like Sally Rooney's writing. Its sparseness has a way of sucking you in. It's blunt and specific. Her pontificating is very thinly veiled, but so is a lot of literature. When she gets poetic, it's surprisingly magnetic.
  highlights:
    - The fact that we are exposed to these people everywhere in our culture, as if they are not only normal but attractive and enviable, indicates the extent of our disfiguring social disease. There is something wrong with them, and when we look at them and learn from them, something goes wrong with us.
    - What if the meaning of life on earth is not eternal progress toward some unspecified goal—the engineering and production of more and more powerful technologies, the development of more and more complex and abstruse cultural forms? What if these things just rise and recede naturally, like tides, while the meaning of life remains the same always—just to live and be with other people?

  description: P. E. Moskowitz is one of my favorite journalists right now, and reading this book solidified that for me.
  highlights:
    - We don’t need to look very far back to know that free speech is a conditional freedom in this country, and that those conditions are nearly always defined by those in power.
    - If we are debating the free speech rights of people like Milo, whom are we ignoring? What about the free speech rights of the people he is recommending we deport or imprison?
    - What is and is not free speech is in the eye of the beholder.

  description: Yet another funny surrealist short story collection! I'm consistent, I loved it! Each story stars a woman named Sarah, from a freshman in college, to a sex worker, to the first Sarah.
  highlights:
    - Probably he talked shit about sex workers and voted Republican, which made Sarah sad to think about because besides probably wanting all women dead, he seemed really sweet.
    - It was amazing, Sarah felt, how whole worlds existed right beside or within the world you thought you were in.

  description: The more Otessa Moshfegh I read, the more I love her writing. This one didn't get as much attention as My Year of Rest and Relaxation, but I liked it more. The mystery and deeply unreliable narrator were more up my alley.
  highlights:
    - The mind must be spoken to, Vesta, otherwise it starts to atrophy. ... "But if the mind talks to itself," I said, "isn't it just saying what it wants to hear?"

  highlights:
    - His joy is raw in a way that makes me feel like I can unzip my skin suit and show him all the ooze inside. But not yet. There is a sadness about his fervor, the way it feels slightly put on, as if he has something to prove.
    - A woman so unthreatened by all of New York's women that she has given this nubile horde a wholesale blessing to fuck her husband.
    - I have come to the part of the night where I am incapable of any uppercase emotion, and every circuit responsible for my cellular regeneration has begun to smoke.

  date: 01/18/2021
  description: This put into words so much of what I've felt about the tech world. I've always observed the tech world has very little interest in the past, and this does a good job tracing back all the platitudes everyone repeats and holds.
  highlights:
    - It describes our tendency to think that the meaning of a work of art comes out of the specific mind of the creator, not out of the preexisting rules that creator worked within nor the broader spirit of society and time.
    - The genius aesthetic that rules the tech industry relies again and again on this purely gestural kind of courage, on hyping everyday things into grand acts of nonconformism and even resistance. You repeat what people around you are saying anyway and get to call yourself a freethinker.
    - The rhetoric of disruption relies on actively misunderstanding and misrepresenting the past.

  description: It took me a while to read this. I finished it when I visited home to see my grandma before she passed away. The timing is appropriate, I suppose.
  highlights:
    - If you see a person crying inside a car, you know they are already held.
    - Empathy can be a hole through which one falls into despair.

  description: The amount I talk about and recommend this book now is very annoying. You've been warned.
  highlights:
    - People feel they have been let in on a deep secret of the universe, and they cannot be shaken from that conviction.
    - And then there was this light, it was the pure light of love and divinity, and it was with me and no words were needed.

  description: I discovered a love of prose poetry and this kicked off a phase of learning Joni Mitchell on the piano (including Blue, of course).
  highlights:
    - Do not, however, make the mistake that all desire is yearning.
    - At the bottom of the swimming pool, I watched the white winter light spangle the cloudy blue and I knew together they made God.
    - At times I fake my enthusiasm. At others, I fear I am incapable of communicating the depth of it.

  highlights:
    - Mia realized that she was crossing into a place she would have to go alone.

  description: I really liked Tolentino's essays, but I almost already agreed with them so much that I found reading this kind of boring?
  highlights:
    - Writing is either a way to shed my self-delusions or a way to develop them. A well-practiced, conclusive narrative is usually a dubious one.

    - Judaism had taught her to keep running, no matter who tried to hold her hostage. It had taught her to create her own opportunities, to turn rock into water and water to blood. It had taught her that such things were possible.
    - Something is pulling her back to the person she’s been all along.

  description: Carmen Maria Machado is my favorite author right now and I was so excited
    to read this memoir. She puts words to the felt but unspoken like no other. She
    brings to light how unproductive archetypes of traumatic experiences can be, and
    how the subtleties of the less extreme ones can fall through the cracks.
  highlights:
    - I toss the stone of my story into a vast crevice; measure the emptiness by its small sound.
    - The nature of archival silence is that certain people's narratives and their nuances are swallowed by history; we see only what pokes through because it is sufficiently salacious for the majority to pay attention.

  date: 11/03/2019
  description: This crystalized so many things I've been feeling and thinking lately.
    What I actually have to say about this book needs much more than a little blurb
    here. This presents a reframing on our lives today that we'd all benefit from
    reflecting on. It also inspired me to start learning the trees around San Francisco,
    particularly at the park I mostly read this book in.
  highlights:
    - Yet we inhabit a culture that privileges novelty and growth over the cyclical and the regenerative. Our very idea of productivity is premised on the idea of producing something new, whereas we do not tend to see maintenance and care as productive in the same way.

  date: 09/12/2019
  highlights:
    - It is the story of the ugly decisions made around user data and personal information as technology firms seek to exploit consumer data. But most of all, it is a story about how blind worship of startup founders can go wildly wrong, and a cautionary tale that ends in spectacular disaster.

  description: This is a story about the apocalypse, but it is much more a story about
    our routines and how they form us.
  highlights: To live in a city is to live the life that it was built for, to adapt
    to its schedule and rhythms, to move within the transit layout made for you during
    the morning and evening rush, winding through the crowds of fellow commuters.
    To live in a city is to consume its offerings. To eat at its restaurants. To drink
    at its bars. To shop at its stores. To pay its sales taxes. To give a dollar to
    its homeless.

  description: This is the funniest book I've read in such a long time. I thought
    it was actually really loving towards men and it was a good reminder that dating
    is supposed to be fun. I loved her point about how easy it is for women to fall
    into supporting a partner, and how important it is to forge your own path and
    focus on your own art.
  highlights:
    - 'Whatever happens will happen, but the pay is certain: you''ll always be able to write, or talk, or paint, or knit (why do people knit??) about it. You can make it into something beautiful or hilarious or genius or so incredibly dumb that it''s hilarious and genius.'

  date: 05/27/2019
  description: This book is about a woman who basically takes a butt load of drugs
    and fucks off for a year. It's from her point of view, so as you can imagine,
    this was incredibly depressing, and made me feel kind of insane. But I must have
    liked it because I plowed through it in one day, and it was actually weirdly funny.

  description: I love this one so much I've been rereading it. I'm forced me to grapple
    with the absurdity of what it feels like to move through the world as myself,
    and it resonates in a way that can only be felt. The way form and structure are
    twisted delights me over and over again. It makes me feel like I'm losing my mind
    in the best way. We live in an illogical world and trying to make sense of it
    is what makes us crazy.

    - And so we stood together like that, at the top of that field for whatseemed like ages, not saying anything, just holding each other, while the windkept blowing and blowing at us, tugging our clothes, and for a moment, it seemed like we were holding onto each other because that was the only way to stop us from being swept away into the night.

  description: I like this book so much that I have trouble getting through it. Every
    sentence feels like a whole universe that I want to soak up and live in. I think
    a lot about how the stories we tell shape our lives and Rebecca Solnit says it
    more beautifully than I ever could.
  highlights:
    - Stories are compasses and architecture, we navigate by them, we build our sanctuaries and our prisons out of them, and to be without a story is to be lost in the vastness of a world that spreads in all directions like arctic tundra or sea ice.
